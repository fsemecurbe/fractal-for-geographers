# Closeread-Prize-Contest-2024

This dataviz is based on my PhD in Quantitative Geography. I try to explain why fractals are useful for people who want to explore the role of scale in geographical knowledge.  

To build the Viz :
```
https://github.com/fsemecurbe/fractal-for_geographers.git
cd fractal-for_geographers
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```
